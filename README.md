# Student-Stress-Analysis
A systemic approach to uncover, analyze, and model the most crucial stress factors among students.

Key Objectives

1. **Identify Core Stress Factors**: Research the primary contributors to student stress, such as academic pressures, social dynamics, and personal well-being factors.
   
3. **Analyze & Visualize Trends**: Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand correlations, patterns, and distributions among key variables.
   
5. **Model & Evaluate Predictive Accuracy**: Build machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to classify stress levels based on selected features, achieving 90%+ accuracy in predictions.
